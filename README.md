# Boilerplate for Solidity development with Foundry

![Github Actions](https://github.com/kalaspuff/solidity-template/workflows/test/badge.svg)

*Template repo with a good base setup to get started when experimenting with smart contracts built in Solidity.* ðŸ’°

### Follows good practice to make it easy to get started

* Comes with both a simple contract and a basic contract with upgradeable functionality.
* Includes deployment scripts to easily deploy to different networks, as well as some basic unit tests.
* Sensible setup for linting with solhint and uses code style formatting from Foundry â€“ VSCode settings for automatic code styling and warnings included.
* Includes some common libraries (such as OpenZeppelin, solmate and contracts from Safe) from the get go to make it easy to prototype.

## Get started

##### initialize your next solidity project with `forge`, using this repo as template

```bash
forge init -t kalaspuff/solidity-template your-new-project-name
# Initializing ./your-new-project-name from https://github.com/kalaspuff/solidity-template...
# Initialized forge project.
```

##### install foundry

In case you haven't installed the Solidity development toolset Foundry (`forge`, `cast` and `anvil`), tollow the installation instructions at <https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html>.

In short, here's the easiest option on macOS and Linux:

```bash
# installs the foundryup shell script
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash

# then use foundryup to install `forge`, `cast` and `anvil`
foundryup
```

#### Build contracts

```bash
forge build

# alternatively with make
make build
```

#### Test

```bash
forge test -vvv

# alternatively with make
make test
```

#### Linting

Requires `solhint` which can be installed with `npm install`.

```bash
npx solhint contracts/**/*.sol
forge fmt --check

# alternatively with make
make lint
```

### Deploy

#### `SimpleContract.sol`

##### Deployment using a script (including verification)

```bash
# specify private key in .env as DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=goerli \
forge script script/deploy/DeploySimple.s.sol -vvvv --verify --broadcast

# deployment with ledger wallet
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=goerli \
FOUNDRY_SENDER=0x39bEb60bc4c1b8b0eBeEDC515c7A56e7DfB3a5A9 \
forge script script/deploy/DeploySimple.s.sol -vvvv --verify --broadcast -l
```

##### Alternative way of deploying using `forge create`

```bash
# deploying using forge create
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=goerli \
forge create --verify --private-key "PRIVATE KEY" \
    contracts/SimpleContract.sol:SimpleContract

# deployment with ledger wallet
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=goerli \
FOUNDRY_SENDER=0x39bEb60bc4c1b8b0eBeEDC515c7A56e7DfB3a5A9 \
forge create --verify -l \
    contracts/SimpleContract.sol:SimpleContract
```

##### Manually verifying a contract if needed

```bash
# verify contract
forge verify-contract \
    --chain goerli \
    --watch \
    "<CONTRACT ADDRESS>" \
    --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor()") \
    contracts/SimpleContract.sol:SimpleContract
```

#### `UpgradeableContract.sol`

##### Deployment using a script (including verification)

```bash
# specify private key in .env as DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=goerli \
forge script script/deploy/DeployUpgradeable.s.sol -vvvv --verify --broadcast

# deployment with ledger wallet
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=goerli \
FOUNDRY_SENDER=0x39bEb60bc4c1b8b0eBeEDC515c7A56e7DfB3a5A9 \
forge script script/deploy/DeployUpgradeable.s.sol -vvvv --verify --broadcast -l
```

##### Manually verifying the contracts if needed

```bash
# verify implementation contract
forge verify-contract \
    --chain goerli \
    --watch \
    "<IMPLEMENTATION ADDRESS>" \
    --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor()") \
    contracts/UpgradeableContract.sol:UpgradeableContract

# verify proxy contract
forge verify-contract \
    --chain goerli \
    --watch \
    "<PROXY ADDRESS>" \
    --constructor-args \
        $(cast abi-encode \
            "constructor(address,bytes)" \
            "<IMPLEMENTATION ADDRESS>" \
            $(cast abi-encode "initialize(address)" "<DEPLOYER ADDRESS>") \
        ) \
    contracts/ERC1967Proxy.sol:ERC1967Proxy
```

## Additional notes

Whenever you install new libraries / dependencies using Foundry (using `foundry install`), make sure to update your `remappings.txt` file by running `forge remappings > remappings.txt`.
